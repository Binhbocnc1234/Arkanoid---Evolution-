## How To Play
It's simple: Break all bricks and advance forward!
Try staying alive for as long as possible to get the max Score!

### Ball & Paddle
Guide your ball with your paddle toward the bricks.
Be careful, if you lose your ball, that's a Game Over! Your score will be resetted to 0 and you will have to do that level again.

### Bricks
There are many types of bricks for you to break:

- Normal: The basic one. Can only tank 1 hit.
- Steel: More strudy than normal brick, can tank another hit.
- Gold: Extra hard, can soak up 3 damage.
- Diamond: The hardest and rarest one. Can take up to 4 damage.
- Obsidian: Basically indestructable.
- TNT: Will help you by creating a 4-way blast upon being destroyed! All bricks affected will take 1 damage.

### Powerups
Beside that, there are also some Powerups to assist you through the levels. They will be reseted every level though.

- Amplify: Extend your paddle's size.
- Spilt: Summon 2 more balls.
- Piercing: Balls now can go through bricks and ignore collision.

- Catchy tunes and sound effects!
- 10 levels for you to enjoy!
